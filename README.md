# Data analysis of investments made on BBC's Dragons' Den show.
In this project I will be looking at data relating to one of my favourite british shows, Dragon's Den, scraped from https://www.tigermobiles.com/dragons-den/. 

In February 2015 tigermobiles made a report on Dragon's Den data which was published by The Sunday Telegraph.
In this analysis, I expand on that report by including data for the last series, adding graphs and approaching the data from some different angles.
